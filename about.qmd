For my work, I mostly use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and occasionally write about aspects I find interesting here.

I'm a main contributor to the [Makie plotting ecosystem](http://makie.juliaplots.org/) for which I wrote the layouting system.
I also maintain a couple of Julia packages such as the data wrangling macro tool [Chain.jl](https://github.com/jkrumbiegel/Chain.jl), the tweening library [Animations.jl](https://github.com/jkrumbiegel/Animations.jl) and the regex helper [ReadableRegex.jl](https://github.com/jkrumbiegel/ReadableRegex.jl).
